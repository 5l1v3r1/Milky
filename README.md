# Milky
A C# library to easily build your own credential stuffing apps.

## Documentation
Not gonna lie, I'm lazy to write one. And to be honest, it probably isn't even needed.

To get started, what you can do is you can check the [examples](https://github.com/Laiteux/Milky/blob/v2/examples) folder, you will then easily understand how Milky works.

Come on, trust me.
